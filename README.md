# PetAteMyHW
A telegram bot that talks to you in natural language, can answer a wide range of questions (from Wolfram Alpha) and/or return a short summary of a topic (from Wikipedia) on command. 

For a demo, try SidiousBot (hosted on Telegram).

INSTRUCTIONS TO DEVELOP:

1. Install python 3.6 on your system and add it to PATH.
2. Using a command line, install python-telegram-bot, by : pip install python-telegram-bot
3. Download the PetAteMyHW repository.
4. Edit the config file to use your API keys.
5. Execute the bot.py file.
6. On Telegram, search for your bot.
7. Start a conversation with the bot, and test away!

NOTE:
I assume you have already set up your bot with Telegram's BotFather. If you have not, please complete the steps given at api.telegram.org, and then come back here.


STATUS UPDATE:
Integration complete! All features now work simultaneously. OCR coming soon... 
STATUS UPDATE:
Bot deployment is nearly instantaneous now. This was achieved by using the Ubuntu Corpus.
OCR implementation failed. It will live to see another day. :/
